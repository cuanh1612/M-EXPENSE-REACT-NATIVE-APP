## Introduce:
My name is Nguyen Quang Huy, a student at GreenWich University Vietnam. I'm taking the Application Development for Mobile Devices - COMP1786 course. I was asked to create an M-Expense app that allows employees to manage trips and expenses. M-Expense app will be developed on both popular application development platforms, native app and hybrid app.
For native app I choose to use Java, SQLite and Firebase for development. For hybrid app I choose to use React Native Expo and Firebase for development.
